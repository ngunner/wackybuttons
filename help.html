<li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><a href="javascript:funShowHide(document.getElementById('faq19'));">How do you print and what are your printing capabilities?</a>
<div style="display:none" id="faq19"><br />We print using high quality Epson Photo Inkjet Printers (Digital CMYK). We actually use a 6 color ink system (6C Dark/Light) for more accurate color. The paper we use is a special ordered thin custom bright white paper with a matte finish specifically designed for superior color quality and brightness for inkjet printing. We do not print digital laser or offest. Most professional photographers and printing companies agree that our printing process is better for printing buttons rather than laser or offset. This is because our printing method avoids double refraction which you get from combining 2 glossy finishes on top of each other. Combining glossy inks or paper and the clear plastic cover of the button can create this illusion. A button product with double refraction does not look bad, but when compared to our product side by side the glossy button will look a little weird like it has oil is underneath the cover. Our flat matte finish offers a more crystal clear image on the button itself.

<noscript><br />We print using high quality Epson Photo Inkjet Printers (Digital CMYK). We actually use a 6 color ink system (6C Dark/Light) for more accurate color. The paper we use is a special ordered thin custom bright white paper with a matte finish specifically designed for superior color quality and brightness for inkjet printing. We do not print digital laser or offest. Most professional photographers and printing companies agree that our printing process is better for printing buttons rather than laser or offset. This is because our printing method avoids double refraction which you get from combining 2 glossy finishes on top of each other. Combining glossy inks or paper and the clear plastic cover of the button can create this illusion. A button product with double refraction does not look bad, but when compared to our product side by side the glossy button will look a little weird like it has oil is underneath the cover. Our flat matte finish offers a more crystal clear image on the button itself.<br /> <br /></noscript>

<li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><a href="javascript:funShowHide(document.getElementById('faq18'));">Do you Pantone match or use PMS colors?</a>
<div style="display:none" id="faq18"><br />We print CMYK using Epson inkjet printers. We are only able to closely match to the pantone system. We cannot achieve an exact match because we do not print pantone. We print on matte coated paper and can closely match to pantone matte and pantone coated colors. We will need to know prior to printing your buttons that you want a pantone match. If you do not tell us ahead of time we may not know that you are expecting your colors to match the pantone system.
