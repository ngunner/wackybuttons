			<p class="lead">We are a button company located in East Rochester, NY. We have been in business now for over 10 years. We started out as a home based business, then moved to a main street shop, and now we do business in an industrial warehouse. We have grown quite a bit, but we are still a small company with under 10 employees. Since we are a small company, we are easy to contact and work with for all your button making needs. Our goal is to provide the highest quality button products in the fastest amount of time to our customers. We utilize the latest technology for setting up and processing custom designs. Our website is easy to use and we collect very little information on our customers. Our customer service is friendly, fast, and we are always glad to help. We love making buttons and are always interested in what people come up with. If you are ever in town feel free to stop on by and make some buttons with us.</p>
